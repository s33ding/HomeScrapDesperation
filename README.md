# HomeScrapDesperation

**HomeScrapDesperation** is a personal project to automate my search for apartments in **CLN**, a commercial area in Brasília known for its small, affordable apartments on top of shops. These apartments are well-located, but it's tough to find ones in good condition with a nice view. This scraper helps me stay on top of new listings, which is my best hope for finding the right place.

## What It Does

- Scrapes new apartment listings from DF Imóveis daily, focusing on CLN.
- Retrieves apartment descriptions, image URLs, listing links, and Cresci numbers (real estate registration).

## Why This Matters

Finding an apartment in CLN that meets my needs is difficult. This project automates the search, giving me a better chance of acting fast when something good appears.

## Future Plans

- Automate daily scraping and add custom alerts for listings that meet my criteria.
